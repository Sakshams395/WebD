                <p class="mq2">We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the 
                    impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, 
                    to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our 
                    proudest achievements. ~Cooper
